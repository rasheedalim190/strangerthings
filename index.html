    <h1>Lore</h1>
    <p>The lore of Stranger Things is deeply rooted in 1980s pop culture and science fiction. The series draws inspiration from classic horror films, such as Stephen King's works, and the era's fascination with government conspiracies and supernatural phenomena. The fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, serves as a backdrop for exploring themes of friendship, growing up, and the unknown. The show's central mystery revolves around the Upside Down, a parallel dimension that is connected to the main world through a portal. This dimension is home to various supernatural creatures and entities that are both terrifying and mysterious.</p>
    <p>The final chapter of Stranger Things unfolds in November 1987, nineteen months after the devastating “Earthquake” that reshaped Hawkins. The Upside Down’s influence is stronger than ever, and the boundaries between worlds begin to collapse. Secrets buried since Season 1 resurface, tying together government experiments, Vecna’s rise, and the fate of Eleven’s powers. This season closes the circle on the mythology, revealing the origins of the Upside Down and the ultimate battle for Hawkins.</p>
